In simple hill climbing, the first closer node is chosen,
 whereas in steepest ascent hill climbing all successors are compared and the closest to the solution is chosen.
  Both forms fail if there is no closer node, which may happen if there are local maxima in the search space which are not solutions.
  Steepest ascent hill climbing is similar to best-first search,
which tries all possible extensions of the current path instead of only one.
