Algorithm for Simple Hill climbing:

1.Assess the current state. If it is the goal state, return success.
2.If step 1 didn't return success, loop through through the current state's neighbours:
3.Pick a new state and assess it:
    3.1. If it is the goal state, return success and exit.
    3.2. Else if it is better than the current state we had assessed, assign this new state as the current state.
    3.3. Else if it is not better than the current state, then return to Step 2 and continue looping.
4.Exit.
